1.0
 - suggestion sorting has been totally reworked.  it should pretty much DTRT 
   in most cases.  for details see the chart in sub _match.  among other 
   changes, window activity level is now taken into account.

0.9
 - bugfix: type sorting should come after exact match (thanks Juerd!)
 - if your input has a second word, this word is assumed to be (at least 
   partially, front anchored) the network name and must match.  this helps
   disambiguate nicknames or channels across multiple networks in a
   deterministic way if you don't want to tab cycle.

0.8
 - /go foobar<tab> now does The Right Thing, but only in 0.8.12 or better since
   some of the required functionality wasn't available until then.
 - small tweak to sorting, for when you type a channel's name without the #

0.7
 *** SCRIPT NAME CHANGE ***
 - it turns out that there's already a go.pl which is similar, but not as advanced,
   so this script is being renamed to go2.pl.  The command itself has not changed,
   however, and is still invoked as /go

 - bugfix: squash extra results in tab-cycle when no input
 - pressing Esc now lets you cancel
 - less duplication in suggestions
 - try to sort suggestions in a useful way
 - argument form now has some better automagic matching logic (thanks to zigdon)

0.6
 - online help (/go help)
 - allow argument to /go in order to jump directly to a location (/go #channel)

0.5
 - support matching 'tag' (network or server name)

0.4
 - display window number in suggestions and allow you to match on it

0.3
 - support ^U for clearing input

0.2
 - allow any submatch to be found, not just front-anchored
 - display window tag (ircnet) in suggestion for disambiguation
 - provide both name and item if both are set

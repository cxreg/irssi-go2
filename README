This makes switching windows in irssi easier.

Install it like

  mkdir -p ~/.irssi/scripts
  cp go2.pl ~/.irssi/scripts


Load it like

  /script load go2

If you want it automatically loaded for you, instead do

  mkdir -p ~/.irssi/scripts/autorun/
  ln -s ~/.irssi/scripts/go2.pl ~/.irssi/scripts/autorun/


Use it like

  /go<enter>

  That's the actual enter key, not the string "<enter>".  Duh.

  You're then presented with a prompt

    Goto:

  Start typing the name of a window, its item (channel, nickname, etc), its
  number, or its connected network.  go2.pl will attempt to guess what you
  are looking for and suggest it in inverse text.  Pressing tab will cycle
  through its possible suggestions.  Pressing enter again will select the
  currently suggested window or item and switch to it for you.


If you prefer, you can enter your destination with the command such as

  /go #channel<enter>

  In this case, if it finds exactly one match, you'll go directly to it.  If
  not, you'll go to the prompt with any possible suggestions presented as usual.


If you are using irssi 0.8.12 or better, you can also do

  /go something<tab>

  and it will try to guess what you meant, or else take you to the prompt.


If you type a space and a second word, the second word is assumed to be a
network name, which helps disambiguate your input and reduce the amount of
tab cycling you have to do

  /go foo bar


There is online help which says more or less the same as what you read here,
available as

  /go help


You might also find it useful to bind to a key, such as

  /bind meta-w /go
